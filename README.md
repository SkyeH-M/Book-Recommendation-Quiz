## User Experience (UX)
### Project Goals
The principal goal for this book recommendation quiz site is to allow users to read each of the 10 questions, select an answer for each based on their preferences, and then receive personalised book recommendations. 

* The quiz allows a user to input their name, or a username, so that when given recommendations this is displayed with their name. For example, upon submitting the quiz text will appear stating "Hi (insert username here), you got (insert genre here)! We recommend the following books...". This creates a more personalised feel to the delivery of the recommendations.
* Once a user has answered all 10 questions a message will be displayed, as mentioned above, stating the genre the user has been matched with (explain how matching works here?????????). This is accompanied by an image of the three book covers corresponding to the genre selected by the user's answers. 
* The quiz will allow users to retake the quiz as many times as they like, either by refreshing the browser, or by clicking the Restart button. This is so that users can see which other books are recommended, or even share the quiz with friends from their own device. 

### Developer and Business Goals
* The footer includes social media icons which contain links to various social media platforms. This pertains to a developer and business goal of encouraging users to visit the content of the business who created the quiz. This seems most appropriate for a book shop where a book recommendation quiz may be utilised to encourage customers to purchase new books they have yet to discover. 
* A key developer goal for this project was to ensure full accessibility for all users of the quiz. This goal informed my decision to not create a quiz with correct answers and a timer as I didn't want to rush users. Part of this consideration was with dyslexic individuals in mind as it will take different people different amount of time to read text.
* A business goal could be to encourage users to share their personalised book recommendations with others, thereby advertising the company behind the quiz. With this in mind there are no copyright images used on the site so users can share screenshots of their results on social media if they wish.

### User Stories
As a user I want to be able to...

1. Read each question and answer clearly, with no text being confusing or obscured by anything else
2. To be able to take the quiz on any device, regardless of size or model, and have a good, uncomplicated experience which only differs slightly depending on screen size. This includes all key functionality of the site working on mobile, tablet, and desktop
3. Answer each of the 10 questions and be provided with an accurate group of recommendations that suit the answers I selected
4. To be able to restart the quiz if I change my mind on an answer for a question I've already answered, and for this to have no negative consequences
5. To be recommended books I might not be familiar with already, but are still likely to interest me
